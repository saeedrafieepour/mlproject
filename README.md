## Overview

This project aims to analyze the factors that impact student performance in math, reading, and writing exams. By exploring the dataset, we can uncover relationships between demographic factors and exam scores, which may help educational institutions improve student outcomes.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains information about 1000 students, including:

- **Gender**: Male or Female
- **Race/Ethnicity**: Group A, B, C, D, E
- **Parental Level of Education**: Education level of the student's parent
- **Lunch**: Type of lunch (standard or free/reduced)
- **Test Preparation Course**: Completed or not completed
- **Math Score**: Score in math exam (0-100)
- **Reading Score**: Score in reading exam (0-100)
- **Writing Score**: Score in writing exam (0-100)
